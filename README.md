# GitHub Reminder

A browser extension that reminds you to make a GitHub commit every day.

The extension does a daily check if a commit has been made to GitHub. The extension uses the system's notifications to notify the user when a commit has not been made during that timeframe. You will also receive some positive reinforcement when a commit has been made. This is still a WIP, but should be functional in developer mode. An install guide and public release will be available soon.

> [!NOTE]
> This extension does require you to generate your own GitHub PAT token. You should not be rate limited as the time settings are hard-coded, but this may be modified in a future release.
